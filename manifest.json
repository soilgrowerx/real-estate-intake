    <description>Overhauled the form submission process to include PDF generation and a simulated backend call. Added state management for the submission process (isSubmitting, submitStatus) to provide clear user feedback. The submit button is now disabled during submission and shows a loading state.</description>

    <description>Created a new utility to handle form submission. This file contains a placeholder function that simulates sending form data and a generated PDF to a backend server. Detailed comments guide the necessary backend implementation for Google Sheets, Drive, and email integration.</description>
    <content><![CDATA[/**
 * Handles the submission of form data and the generated PDF to a backend service.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This function is a placeholder. For this to work in a real application,
 * you need to create a backend server (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or a serverless
 * function like Google Cloud Functions). The backend will be responsible for securely
 * handling API credentials and interacting with Google Sheets, Google Drive, and an
 * email service.
 *
 * @param {object} formData - The structured data from the intake form.
 * @param {Blob} pdfBlob - The generated PDF file as a Blob.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves when the submission is complete.
 */
export const submitDataToBackend = async (formData: object, pdfBlob: Blob): Promise<void> => {
  // 1. Create a FormData object to send both JSON and the PDF file.
  //    This is suitable for a 'multipart/form-data' request.
  const submissionData = new FormData();
  submissionData.append('jsonData', JSON.stringify(formData));
  submissionData.append('pdfFile', pdfBlob, `Intake_Form_${new Date().toISOString()}.pdf`);

  // 2. Define the backend endpoint.
  //    This URL should point to your own server or serverless function.
  const backendUrl = '/api/submit-intake'; // Example endpoint

  console.log("Simulating submission to backend with the following data:", {
    jsonData: formData,
    pdfFile: pdfBlob
  });

  // 3. Simulate the fetch request.
  //    In a real implementation, you would uncomment the 'fetch' block below.
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500)); // Simulate network delay

  /*
  // --- REAL IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE ---
  // This code would replace the simulation above.

  try {
    const response = await fetch(backendUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: submissionData,
      // Note: Do not set 'Content-Type' header manually when using FormData,
      // the browser will set it correctly with the boundary.
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Try to get a meaningful error message from the backend response
      const errorBody = await response.text();
      throw new Error(`Server responded with ${response.status}: ${errorBody}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log('Backend response:', result);
    return; // Indicates success

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting data to backend:', error);
    // Re-throw the error to be caught by the handleSubmit function in App.tsx
    throw new Error('Could not connect to the submission service.');
  }

  // --- WHAT THE BACKEND SERVER SHOULD DO ---
  //
  // a. Receive the POST request with 'multipart/form-data'.
  // b. Parse the 'jsonData' and 'pdfFile' from the request body.
  // c. Use the Google Sheets API (with server-side authentication) to:
  //    - Connect to your target spreadsheet.
  //    - Append a new row with the parsed form data.
  // d. Use the Google Drive API (with server-side authentication) to:
  //    - Upload the 'pdfFile' to a specified folder.
  // e. Use an email service (like SendGrid, Nodemailer, etc.) to:
  //    - Format an email with the form data.
  //    - Attach the PDF.
  //    - Send the email to the desired recipient.
  // f. Return a success (e.g., 200 OK) or error (e.g., 500) response.
